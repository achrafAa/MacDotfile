This repository contains scripts and configurations to set up a development environment on macOS.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning**
> Since this project uses GNU Stow to create symbolic links, **DO NOT** remove or move the repository folder after installation. Doing so will break all symlinks to your dotfiles. If you need to move the repository:
> 1. Run `make clean` first
> 2. Move the folder
> 3. Run `make dotfiles` again

### Applications

Each package is carefully selected to enhance your development workflow. You can customize the package list by editing the `Brewfile`.

## Dotfiles

Dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). The configuration includes:
- [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org) configuration with plugins
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) setup
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) configuration

### Powerlevel10k Configuration

If you use my `.zsh` dotfile, you'll need to run the Powerlevel10k configuration wizard to install required fonts and choose your preferred style:

```bash
p10k configure
```

This will guide you through the installation of the necessary fonts and allow you to customize the appearance of your terminal prompt.

## Backup

Before installing dotfiles, existing configurations are automatically backed up to the `backups` directory with a timestamp.

## Configuration Files

### Brewfile (`packages/Brewfile`)

The `Brewfile` is a configuration file that defines all packages to be installed via Homebrew. Think of it as a shopping list for your development tools:

```brewfile
# Core utilities
brew "bat"      # Regular package installation
brew "eza"      # Regular package installation
cask "iterm2"   # macOS application installation
```

To modify your package list:
1. Edit `packages/Brewfile`
2. Add packages using:
   - `brew "package-name"` for CLI tools and libraries
   - `cask "app-name"` for macOS applications
3. Run `make install` to install new packages

### Dotfiles List (`dotfiles/dotfiles_list.conf`)

The `dotfiles_list.conf` tells Stow which dotfile folders to symlink to your home directory:

```conf
# Shell Configuration
zsh            # Will symlink dotfiles/zsh/.* to ~/.* 

# Vim Configuration
nvim          # Will symlink dotfiles/nvim/.* to ~/.* 

# tmux Configuration
tmux          # Will symlink dotfiles/tmux/.* to ~/.* 
```

To manage your dotfiles:
1. Add your configuration files to the appropriate folder in `dotfiles/`
2. Ensure the folder is listed in `dotfiles_list.conf`
3. Run `make dotfiles` to create the symlinks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Keep the folder structure in your dotfiles directory matching the structure you want in your home directory. For example:
- `dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc` ‚Üí `~/.zshrc`
- `dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/init.lua` ‚Üí `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`
